Hi! I'm an information systems leader with 20+ years of experience now transitioning to higher education.

### Teaching

I believe in creating an experiential learning environment where students apply theory to solve real-world problems. This approach helps equip students with critical thinking and practical skills demanded by information systems careers.

As a Teaching Assistant during my graduate studies, I developed and taught curriculum for a data communications lab serving over 100 undergraduate students. I mentored high school students in the AFA [CyberPatriot](https://www.uscyberpatriot.org/) competition. And I've developed corporate cyber security training.

These experiences solidified my passion for inspiring and supporting learners.

### Professional Career

Graduated from BYU in 2001. Started at EY doing cyber security consulting work and information systems auditing. I went to [Hewitt Associates (acquired by Aon)](https://www.aon.com) where I led disaster recovery, business continuity, and crisis management efforts. I worked for [Carelon](https://www.carelon.com), building a DR program from scratch and helping build their information security program. Then I worked for Motorola Solutions, starting with third-party risk management and growing to lead the governance, risk and compliance team. I then went to Danaher building and leading the GRC team there.
